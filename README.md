# Audio

## DAW

- [OpenVINO](https://www.audacityteam.org/blog/openvino-ai-effects/): OpenVINO AI effects for Audacity
- [](): 

# Music

## Analysis

- [Essentia](https://github.com/MTG/essentia): open-source C++ library for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval  
- [Librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa): Python library for audio and music analysis 
- [DDSP](https://github.com/magenta/ddsp): DDSP is a library of differentiable versions of common DSP functions (such as synthesizers, waveshapers, and filters). This allows these interpretable elements to be used as part of an deep learning model, especially as the output layers for audio generation
- [MIDI-DDSP](https://github.com/magenta/midi-ddsp?tab=readme-ov-file): MIDI-DDSP is a hierarchical audio generation model for synthesizing MIDI expanded from DDSP
- [](): 

## Production

- [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter): Deezer source separation library including pretrained models

## Generation

- [StableAudio](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools): Generative models for conditional audio generation 
- [AudioCraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft): a PyTorch library for deep learning research on audio generation
- [Jukebox](https://github.com/openai/jukebox): A generative model for music
- [Magenta](https://github.com/magenta/symbolic-music-diffusion): symbolic music generation with diffusion models 
- [] (): 


# Speech

## Recognition

- [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper): a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification
- [Deep Speech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech): Mozilla's open-source speech-to-text engine
- [Kaldi ASR](https://kaldi-asr.org/): open-source speech recognition toolkit written in C++ 
- [](): 

## Production

- [Descript audio codec](https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec): State-of-the-art audio codec with 90x compression factor. Supports 44.1kHz, 24kHz, and 16kHz mono/stereo audio
- [Descript audio tools](https://github.com/descriptinc/audiotools): Object-oriented handling of audio data, with GPU-powered augmentations, and more
- [Meta encodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec): State-of-the-art deep learning based audio codec supporting both mono 24 kHz audio and stereo 48 kHz audio 

## Synthesis

- [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS): a deep learning toolkit for Text-to-Speech, battle-tested in research and production  
- [DiffSinger] (https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger): singing voice synthesis via shallow diffusion mechanism
